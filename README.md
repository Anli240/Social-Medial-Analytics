# Social-Medial-Analytics
Here is my Social Media Analysis Project using SQL

Problem Statement:
The rise of social media platforms has brought about a wealth of user-generated content and
interactions. Businesses and organizations are keen to understand and leverage this data to
improve their marketing strategies, understand customer sentiments, and identify key
influencers. The challenge lies in effectively analyzing and interpreting the vast amount of social
media data available.

Objectives:
1. Data Collection and Storage: Develop a robust database system to store social media
interactions, user profiles, content engagement metrics, and network connections.
2. Analytics and Insights: Create SQL queries to analyze user engagement patterns,
identify influencers, measure the impact of social media campaigns, and perform
sentiment analysis on user-generated content.
3. Optimization and Strategy: Leverage historical data to forecast future trends, optimize
content strategies, and tailor marketing efforts to target specific demographics.

Database Schema:
The database schema includes the following tables:
1. Users: Stores information about social media users, including user_id, username, email,
and date_joined.
2. Posts: Contains details about user-generated posts, including post_id, user_id (foreign
key from Users table), content, and post_date.
3. Comments: Stores comments made by users on posts, with comment_id, post_id
(foreign key from Posts table), user_id (foreign key from Users table), comment_text,
and comment_date.
4. Likes: Tracks user likes on posts, with like_id, post_id (foreign key from Posts table),
user_id (foreign key from Users table), and like_date.
5. Followers: Manages user following relationships, with follower_id, follower_user_id
(foreign key from Users table), following_user_id (foreign key from Users table), and
follow_date.
